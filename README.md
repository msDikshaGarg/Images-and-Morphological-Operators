# Images-and-Morphological-Operators
PPM images and morphological operations on them using OOP in C++

function, alpha composting function and the image saving function. Upon making a class object
in the main file it first loads the data into as many class objects are created using the load
function. Then operators are applied to perform add/ subtract operations on the images.
